"""Connection manager for real-time operational monitoring
(Milestone 2 outcome) and live alert / train-position push (Milestone 3).

Two ways to push an event:
  - `await manager.broadcast(event, data)` - use from code that's
    already running on the main asyncio event loop (e.g. the crowd/
    train simulators, which are asyncio background tasks).
  - `manager.notify(event, data)` - a sync, thread-safe, fire-and-forget
    version. FastAPI runs plain `def` routes/services in a worker
    thread pool, not on the event loop, so those call this instead of
    awaiting broadcast() directly (see alert_service / schedule_service).
