"""Durable dispatch queue for alert email/SMS notifications.

See app/models/notification_dispatch_job.py for the full "why" behind
this module. Short version: `app/core/notification_executor.py`'s
`ThreadPoolExecutor` is purely in-memory, so a process restart at the
wrong moment silently drops a queued or in-flight dispatch. This
module makes the *decision to dispatch* durable (a committed DB row)
before the *work* is handed to that in-memory pool, and knows how to
find and resubmit anything a previous process didn't finish.

app/api/v1/alerts.py calls `enqueue_and_submit(...)` instead of
`notification_executor.submit(...)` directly for alert email/SMS
dispatch. app/main.py's lifespan calls `recover_pending_jobs()` once
on startup, before the app starts serving traffic.
