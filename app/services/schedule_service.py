    MILESTONE 9 FIX: this used to be duplicated ad-hoc (and incompletely)

    at all, so an operator hitting "Adjust frequency" changed the row in
    Postgres but every dashboard kept serving the pre-edit
    frequency_minutes/is_peak_hour for up to SCHEDULE_CACHE_TTL_SECONDS,
    which is what showed up as stale/incorrect values ("--" once a
    filtered view happened to go from non-empty to empty, or just the
    old number otherwise) on the Train Scheduling page. Reproduced and
    confirmed against a real (in-memory) Redis-backed cache before this
    fix: `list_schedules(state=None)` kept returning the pre-write
    frequency_minutes/delay_minutes after adjust_frequency()/handle_delay()
    committed the new value, because their cache key
    (`schedule:list:None:None:None:None` - the default, no-city-selected

    TTL alone, same documented tradeoff as before (small enough key
    space, short enough TTL, not worth tracking every state a station's
    city could be filtered under).

    BUGFIX: this used to filter on `status == DELAYED` only. `status`
    is a separate field from `delay_minutes` and is only flipped to
    DELAYED by the manual operator `handle_delay` workflow - it is
    NOT derived automatically from delay_minutes anywhere else in
    the app (e.g. seeded/synced rows can have a real delay_minutes
    value with status still ON_TIME). That made this endpoint return
    0 rows forever even with real delay data sitting in the DB.
    Filter on the actual delay value instead (same pattern already
    used in analytics_service.py), and keep the OR on status so any
    row a human explicitly flagged DELAYED still shows even if
    delay_minutes hasn't been (re)recorded.
