"""Dedicated worker pool for outbound email/SMS notification dispatch.

WHY THIS EXISTS (Phase 8 - see docs/notification-delivery.md)
-------------------------------------------------------
Before this module, alert dispatch was scheduled with FastAPI's
`BackgroundTasks.add_task(...)`. That does get the *triggering*
request its response immediately - but Starlette runs a sync
background task via `starlette.concurrency.run_in_threadpool`, which
hands it to AnyIO's *default worker thread limiter*. That is the exact
same shared, capacity-limited thread pool (`anyio.to_thread`, default
40 tokens) that every plain `def` route handler in this app also runs
on - and nearly every route here is a sync `def`, not `async def`
(list_alerts, get_alerts, crowd reads, check-ins, admin actions, ...).

`app/core/email.py`/`app/core/sms.py` are deliberately slow: one
blocking SMTP send or Twilio HTTP POST per recipient, sequentially,
each with its own `timeout=15`. A handful of alerts raised close
together (or one alert with many recipients) can occupy several of
those 40 shared slots for seconds at a time. Once enough of them are
in flight, *unrelated* API requests - which also need a slot from that
same pool just to run their own (fast) handler - start queuing behind
the slow notification sends. That is still "email/SMS blocking API
requests" even though the request that *triggered* the dispatch
already got its response; the effect lands on every *other* concurrent
request instead. Measured locally (see docs/notification-delivery.md): a burst
of 45 concurrent alert dispatches drove concurrent `GET /alerts`
latency from ~10ms to over 20s, with both endpoints eventually
returning 503 (the pool-exhaustion handler in app/main.py firing for
reasons that have nothing to do with the DB pool itself).

THE FIX
-------
Give notification dispatch its own small, bounded `ThreadPoolExecutor`
- completely separate from AnyIO's worker limiter. A burst of slow
notification sends can now only ever compete with *other* notification
dispatches for a thread, never with the pool every other endpoint
depends on. `NOTIFICATION_DISPATCH_WORKERS` (default 2 - see
app/core/config.py; lowered from an earlier default of 8 as a STEP 4
OOM fix for this 512MB instance) caps how many dispatch batches can
run at once; further submissions queue on this executor's own
internal queue instead of stealing capacity from anything else.

This module intentionally has zero dependency on FastAPI/Starlette/
AnyIO - it's a plain `concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor`, submitted
to directly from the sync route handler instead of going through
`BackgroundTasks`.
