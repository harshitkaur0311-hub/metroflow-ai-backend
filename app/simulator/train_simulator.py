    BUGFIX (Phase 29A - stale REST reads after a live tick): this is
    the same helper app/services/train_service.py already defines and
    calls from create_train()/update_train() - duplicated here rather
    than imported, because train_service.py imports
    app.simulator.train_simulator (for get_direction), so importing
    train_service from here would be a circular import.

    Before this fix, every tick in track_tick() below wrote fresh
    positions straight to Postgres and correctly broadcast them over
    the WebSocket, but never touched the Redis cache backing
    GET /trains/live (train_service.list_live_positions). Any client
    that reacted to the train_position push by refetching over REST
    kept getting the previous tick's positions until the cache's TTL
    happened to expire on its own.
