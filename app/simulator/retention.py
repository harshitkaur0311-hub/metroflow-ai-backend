    Both steps are paginated/batched instead of a single unbounded
    pass over the whole backlog:

      - The aggregate SELECT used to run once with a bare `.all()`,
        pulling every (station, hour) bucket the backlog produced into
        one Python list before looping over it and issuing one INSERT
        per bucket. A job that's fallen behind (disabled for a while,
        or a bulk historical import) can turn that into tens of
        thousands of buckets materialized at once just to loop over
        them one at a time. It's now paginated at
        CROWD_ROLLUP_BATCH_SIZE buckets per page, each page upserted
        in a single multi-row INSERT and committed before the next
        page is fetched - memory stays bounded to one page, and no
        single transaction covers the whole backlog.
      - The raw-row delete for the same cutoff goes through
        batched_delete (see app/utils/db_batch.py) for the same
        reason: it used to be one unbounded
        `query.filter(...).delete()` that could hold locks against
        the entire backlog for as long as it took to remove it.
