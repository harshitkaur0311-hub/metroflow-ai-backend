# Database sessions & connection pooling

Covers SQLAlchemy `Session` lifecycle across request handlers,
background loops, and thread-pool code; connection-pool sizing; and
guarding against a worker×pool configuration that would overrun what
Postgres can actually serve.

## Request-scoped session lifecycle — reviewed, already correct

```python
def get_db():
    db = SessionLocal()
    try:
        yield db
        if db.dirty or db.new or db.deleted:
            db.rollback()
    except Exception:
        db.rollback()
        raise
    finally:
        db.close()
```

One session per request, explicit rollback on any unhandled exception,
a defensive rollback if a route forgot to commit its own pending
changes, and `close()` always runs via `finally` regardless of
outcome. No module-level or otherwise shared `Session` object exists
anywhere in the app (verified via an AST scan of every module-level
assignment, not just a grep — a grep-based check can miss a session
built across two statements).

## Long-held connections during slow external I/O

### Bug: alert dispatch held a DB connection across email/SMS sends

`alert_service._dispatch()` runs as a background task with its own DB
session — correctly never the request's own session. But that session
stayed open for the function's **entire body**:

```python
db = SessionLocal()
try:
    alert = db.get(Alert, alert_id)              # connection checked out here
    ...
    results = send_alert_emails(...)              # blocking SMTP, connection still checked out
    _log_results(db, alert.id, ..., results)
    sms_results = send_alert_sms(...)              # blocking Twilio HTTP POST, connection STILL checked out
    _log_results(db, alert.id, ..., sms_results)
finally:
    db.close()
```

SQLAlchemy's `Session` checks out an actual pooled connection lazily,
on its first query — and doesn't release it until the transaction ends
(commit/rollback), which here didn't happen until after both email and
SMS sends returned. For any station with more than a handful of active
users, or a slow/degraded provider endpoint, that's realistically
seconds spent holding one pool slot that could otherwise be serving a
request — not a long-running *query*, but a long-held *connection*
across unrelated slow I/O.

**Fix:** restructured into three independent steps, each with its own
short-lived session — read (fetch everything needed into plain Python
values, close immediately), send (no DB session open at all), log
(open a second short session purely to write the result rows and
commit). See
[notification-delivery.md](./notification-delivery.md) for how this
interacts with the dedicated notification thread pool added
separately.

Measured with a concurrency harness against a small pool (size 5,
timeout 2s), 20 concurrent simulated alert dispatches: before the fix,
10/20 succeeded and 10/20 hit a controlled timeout; after, 20/20
succeeded, 0/20 timed out.

### Investigated and ruled out: JWKS fetch during `get_current_user`

`get_current_user` calls `_decode_supabase_token(token)`, which does a
blocking JWKS refetch (`urllib.request.urlopen(timeout=5)`) whenever
its 600s cache is stale — the same *shape* of bug as the alert-dispatch
one, and on the hot path of nearly every authenticated request, so it
was investigated closely. It isn't a live bug: SQLAlchemy's `Session`
acquires its pooled connection lazily on its first *query*, not at
construction — `Depends(get_db)` becoming available happens before any
query has run, and the JWKS fetch runs before the first query
(`_get_or_create_profile`). No pool connection is actually checked out
during the JWKS fetch. Recorded here so this doesn't get
re-investigated from scratch later.

## No server-side statement timeout

`pool_pre_ping=True` catches a *dead* connection before handing it
out, and `pool_recycle` retires old connections proactively — neither
protects against a connection that's perfectly healthy but stuck
mid-query (a lock wait, an unindexed scan on a large table, a network
blip partway through a round trip). `pool_timeout` doesn't help
either: it only bounds how long a *new* request waits to *acquire* a
connection, not how long an already-checked-out connection is allowed
to keep running one statement.

Fixed with `DB_STATEMENT_TIMEOUT_MS` (default 30000 = 30s;
`app/core/config.py`), passed to Postgres via psycopg2's `options`
connect arg (`-c statement_timeout=<ms>`) in
`app/database/database.py`, applied only when `DATABASE_URL` is a
`postgresql` URL. A statement that runs longer than this is now
cancelled by the server itself, raising a normal, catchable
`sqlalchemy.exc.OperationalError` — protecting the connection from
ever getting stuck, one layer earlier than `pool_timeout` alone would.

## Pool sizing — Step 7 OOM fix: tightened again for Render Free (512MB)

Current defaults (`app/core/config.py`): `DB_POOL_SIZE=3`,
`DB_MAX_OVERFLOW=2` → 5 connections per process (`WEB_CONCURRENCY=1`).
This is the second tightening pass — an earlier pass had already
lowered the original `15`/`25` (40-connection) defaults to `5`/`5`
(10-connection); measurement on Render Free showed even that 10-slot
ceiling was more headroom than one worker process needs, and every
pooled connection carries its own psycopg2/libpq client-side buffers
that count against the 512MB limit whether or not it's ever checked
out — so the ceiling itself is memory pressure, not just a safety
margin.

**Do not blindly increase these** — raising them without first
checking for a connection-holding bug like the alert-dispatch one
above would only mask the symptom, consume more of Postgres's own
connection budget, and make the same bug harder to notice next time it
mattered.

`pool_timeout=15s` (was `10s`) bounds how long a request waits for a
connection before failing controllably (503 via
`db_pool_exhausted_handler`) — nudged up slightly since there are now
fewer slots to wait for. `pool_recycle=1800s` (was `300s`) recycles
pooled connections every 30 minutes instead of every 5; the shorter
value was needlessly churning fresh connections (each reconnect
briefly allocates its own setup buffers), and 30 minutes still
comfortably beats hosted-Postgres idle-kill windows. `pool_pre_ping=True`
is unchanged and already correct.

## Worker × pool capacity: refusing to boot an unsafe configuration

Under leader-election-based multi-worker deployment (see
[background-jobs-and-leader-election.md](./background-jobs-and-leader-election.md)),
the real cluster-wide connection ceiling is `(DB_POOL_SIZE +
DB_MAX_OVERFLOW) × worker count`, not just the per-process number — a
fact that wasn't visible anywhere. A first pass added an informational
log line stating the formula, but it never knew the real worker count
or Postgres's real `max_connections`, so it could only log a formula,
never actually catch a genuinely unsafe configuration before it failed
under load.

Fixed with:

- **`WEB_CONCURRENCY`** (new setting, default `1`) — the number of
  worker processes this deployment runs, named to match the
  gunicorn/Heroku-style env var convention so it's set once wherever
  the process manager is configured.
- **`DB_CONNECTION_RESERVE`** (new setting, default `10`) — connections
  Postgres needs to have spare outside this app's own pool ceiling,
  for migrations, admin sessions, and monitoring tools.
- `app/database/database.py`:
  - `_fetch_postgres_max_connections()` — a single ad-hoc, 5s-timeout
    `psycopg2` connection (deliberately *not* through the pooled
    engine, so this check can never itself consume a pool slot), runs
    `SHOW max_connections;`. Returns `None` (never raises) if Postgres
    isn't reachable right now, so an availability problem degrades
    this to "unverified" instead of blocking startup for an unrelated
    reason.
  - `check_pool_capacity(...)` — pure arithmetic, no I/O: computes
    `(pool_size + max_overflow) × web_concurrency` and compares it to
    `max_connections - reserve`. Raises `RuntimeError` with an
    actionable message (names the exact settings to change) if the
    ceiling would exceed safe capacity.
  - `_verify_pool_capacity_or_raise()` — calls both at import time
    (app startup, and any script that imports the engine) and refuses
    to boot if the config is unsafe. If `max_connections` couldn't be
    determined, falls back to logging the formula instead of blocking.

This capacity check's own logic wasn't changed by the Step 7 pool
tightening above — at the shipped defaults (`WEB_CONCURRENCY=1`)
against a typical `max_connections=100` Postgres, it passes with even
more room to spare now (`5 ≤ 90`, down from `10 ≤ 90` before this
step); it only refuses to start when an operator's own scaling choice
(more workers, or a smaller Postgres tier) would actually be unsafe.

## Simulator loop session hygiene

`csv_replay_simulator.run_forever()`, `train_simulator.run_forever()`,
and `retention.run_forever()` each open a session per tick and close
it in `finally`. If the tick function raised after staging changes but
before its own commit, `close()` alone happens to roll back the open
transaction (documented SQLAlchemy behavior), so this was never a live
bug — but relying on that implicitly is fragile against a future
refactor. An explicit `db.rollback()` was added in the `except` block
of all three, before `close()`, so a dirty session is never handed
back to the pool by accident. `retention.run_forever()` particularly
benefits, since one pass does three separate query+commit steps on the
same session.

## Row-level locking for check-in/check-out — reviewed, already correct

Covered in
[crowd-live-state-and-retention.md](./crowd-live-state-and-retention.md) —
`apply_live_state_delta()` uses `SELECT ... FOR UPDATE` to serialize
concurrent same-station updates, and its caller commits and broadcasts
promptly, with no lock held across anything slow.
